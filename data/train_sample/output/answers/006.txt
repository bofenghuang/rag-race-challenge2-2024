You can easily monitor the average duration between a tweet creation and its deletion using Twitter API v2 compliance. Two steps are involved:

**Step 1** : Get the tweets IDS

A tweet id can be easily inferred from the URL which is of the form `https://twitter.com/XXX/status/[TWEET_ID]`. You will have to gather the list of ids corresponding to the hateful tweets that you have and store them in a text file.

**Step 2** : Get the tweets compliance status 

Then you can use Twitter v2 batch compliance API which allows you to retrieve the compliance status of a set of tweets. You would be interested in the status `deleted`.
By periodically querying this API, you can compute the percentage of tweets that were deleted and how long it took for those tweets to be deleted.

There are 4 steps involved in working with this endpoint (https://api.twitter.com/2/compliance/jobs):

1. **Create a compliance job**
You can specify the job type (here `tweets`). You can have one concurrent job per job type at any time.

2. **Upload your dataset to the `upload_url`**
Next, you upload your dataset as a plain text file to the provided upload_url, with each line of the file containing a single Tweet ID. The upload_url expires after 15 minutes.

3. **(Optional) Check the job status**
You can check the status of your compliance job to see whether it is created, in_progress, failed or complete.

4. **Download the results**
When your job is complete, you can download the results using the download_url. The download_url expires after one week (from when the job was created).

This result will contain a set of JSON objects (one object per line). Each object will contain a Tweet ID, the Tweetâ€™s creation date (useful to locate Tweets organized by date), required action, the reason for the compliance action, and the date the user was suspended.
