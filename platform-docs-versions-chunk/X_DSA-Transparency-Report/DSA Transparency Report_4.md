## Enforcement Activity Summary Data

RESTRICTED REACH LABELS DATA: FREEDOM OF SPEECH, NOT REACH

Our mission at X is to promote and protect the public conversation. We believe X users have the right to express their opinion and ideas without fear of censorship. We also believe it is our responsibility to keep users on our platform safe from content that violates our [rules](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/x-rules&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1700092924690749&usg=AOvVaw1G7wSHLDAeqAt14E_N2fLJ).

These beliefs are the foundation of Freedom of Speech, Not Reach - our freedom of expression based enforcement philosophy which means, where appropriate, restricting the reach of posts that are classified as potentially meeting our threshold for enforcement under our Hateful Conduct, Abuse & Harassment, Civic Integrity, and Violent Speech policies. Please note these policies have a range of enforcement actions, such as removal, suspension, and restricted reach.

Restricting the reach of posts, also known as visibility filtering, is one of our existing enforcement actions that allows us to move beyond the binary “leave up versus take down” approach to content moderation. Posts with these labels will be made less discoverable on the platform. This can include:

* Excluding the post from search results, trends, and recommended notifications;
* Removing the post from the For you and Following timelines;
* Restricting the post’s discoverability to the author’s profile;
* Downranking the post in replies;
* Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts, Quote posts, bookmarks, share, pin to profile, or Edit post.

Additionally, these labels bring transparency to this enforcement action by displaying which policy the post potentially violates to both the author and other users on X, and communicating that the post’s visibility is limited. Authors can submit a complaint on the label if they think we incorrectly limited their post’s visibility.
