Important Notes about indicators of accuracy:

1. For some official languages we did not collect data, such as Maltese, or very little data, including Irish, Lithuanian, and Slovenian.
2. The underlying volume of appeals and overturns for the enforcements shown may be low, which can result in relatively high overturn rates.
3. Overturn rates are calculated by dividing the number of overturned enforcements by the number of enforcement appeals.
4. For suspensions, appeals, and overturns used, we used the following measurement approach:

* Within the time window
* Review last suspension per user
* Assign appeal on/after that date to that suspension
* Log outcome of that appeal

5. The tables in the section INDICATORS OF ACCURACY FOR SUSPENSIONS have been updated on 1 November 2023 following updates to the tables COMPLAINTS OF ACTIONS TAKEN FOR TIUC TERMS OF SERVICE AND RULES VIOLATIONS RECEIVED/DECISIONS.
