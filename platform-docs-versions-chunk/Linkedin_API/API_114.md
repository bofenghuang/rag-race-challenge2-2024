## Secure APIs

To prevent others from reading your requests and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, all OAuth 2.0 requests to our authentication servers must be done over HTTPS. Your application should also be hosted on a secure server, particularly for pages where a member enters private information (such as their password for your site) and for any URLs where you ask LinkedIn to redirect the member as part of the OAuth authorization flow.
