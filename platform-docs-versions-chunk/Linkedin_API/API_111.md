# Best Practices for Secure Applications

At LinkedIn, we take the privacy of our members very seriously. When we grant access to APIs, we expect developers to take member privacy just as seriously as we do. The LinkedIn platform uses permissions to protect and prevent abuse of our members' information. By using the [OAuth 2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow) authentication protocol, we allow an application to access LinkedIn data while protecting members' credentials. Because of this protocol, members are ensured that applications on our platform are easy to use _and_ protect their privacy and security.

Note

You should always request the minimal scopes necessary and only request permissions that are needed for application functionality.

Ensure your application follows these best practices.
