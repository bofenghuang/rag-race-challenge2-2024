## Phishing Prevention

Cybercriminals often create websites that look and feel authentic but are really just replicas created to steal user credentials. Educate your users to look for signs to ensure they are entering credentials for a real LinkedIn application. Note that browsers may look different, and this may not always be enough to differentiate a legitimate site from a phishing site. Alert members not to enter credentials when in doubt and to contact you when they suspect suspicious activity.

LinkedIn has a DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server Certificate (padlock) that can be viewed prior to the URL in the browser. The base URL hostname is always "[https://www.linkedin.com/](https://www.linkedin.com/)...". Beware of URLs that try to mimic LinkedIn by using common misspellings or swapping similar characters such as "1" (one) for "l" (letter 'L'), e.g., "l1inkedIn.com/", or "linked1n.com/".
