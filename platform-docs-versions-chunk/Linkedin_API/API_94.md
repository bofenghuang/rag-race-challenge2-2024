## Requirements for Processing Notifications

Upon receiving notifications from LinkedIn, your webhook must fulfill the following requirements:

#### Verify the integrity of the push event and prevent malicious entities from impersonating LinkedIn as the sender

The POST request sent by LinkedIn will include a header called `X-LI-Signature`. The value of this header is the HMACSHA256 hash of the JSON-encoded string representation of the POST body prefixed by `hmacsha256=` and it is computed using your appâ€™s clientSecret. On receiving the push event, you must compute the signature on the POST body prefixed by `hmacsha256=` using the HMACSHA256 hashing algorithm and your clientSecret. Discard the event if your computed value does not match the value sent in the `X-LI-Signature` header.

#### Deduplicate notifications

A notification can occasionally be delivered multiple times to your webhook. Your webhook must be able to deduplicate notifications using the Notification ID included in the payload.

#### Respond with an HTTP response

For each notification delivered to your webhook, it must return a 2xx HTTP status code to indicate successful delivery of the notification to your webhook. Any other response code returned will be treated by LinkedIn as a failure.

#### Test with lambda/serverless functions on a cloud provider

We recommend testing webhooks processing using lambda/serverless functions on a cloud provider.
