## Overview

The OAuth Sample Application is a ready-to-use code example that you can readily use to try out RESTful OAuth calls to the LinkedIn Authentication server. This version of the sample application is based on Java. The OAuth sample application shown below provides scalable and customizable code for your requirements as you begin API development with LinkedIn.

The sample application contains the client and server components you can use to manage your request calls to LinkedIn's APIs. The server creates and stores your access token and invokes APIs upon request from the client application.You can download or clone the OAuth sample application and try out these APIs as shown in the demo.

The OAuth sample application uses the following development tools:

* Spring Boot: provides the web server framework \[[https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)\]
* LinkedIn OAuth 2.0: user authorization and API authentication
