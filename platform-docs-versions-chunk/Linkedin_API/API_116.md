## Cross-Site Request Forgery

To protect against [CSRF attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), during authorization, you must pass a `state` parameter. This should be a unique string value (for each request) that is unique, difficult to guess, and should not contain private or sensitive information.

### Sample State Value

    state=760iz0bjh9gy71asfFqa
    

On successful authorization, the redirected URL should look like:

### Sample Callback URL

    https://OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URI/?code=AUTH_CODE&state=760iz0bjh9gy71asfFqa
    

Make sure that the state parameter in the response matches the one you passed in your authorization request. If the state does not match, the request may be a result of CSRF and should be rejected.
