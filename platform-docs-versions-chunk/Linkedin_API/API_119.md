## Definition

A **breaking change** is a change that may require you to make changes to your application in order to avoid disruption to your integration. The following are a few examples of changes we consider breaking:

* Changes to existing permission definitions
* Removal of an allowed parameter, request field or response field
* Addition of a required parameter or request field without default values
* Changes to the intended functionality of an endpoint. _For example, if a DELETE request previously used to archive the resource but now hard deletes the resource._
* Introduction of a new validation

A **non-breaking change** is a change that you can adapt to at your own discretion and pace without disruption. In most cases, we will communicate non-breaking changes after they are already made. Ensure that your application is designed to be able to handle the following types of non-breaking changes without prior notice from LinkedIn:

* Addition of new endpoints
* Addition of new methods to existing endpoints
* Addition of new fields in the following scenarios:
    * New fields in responses
    * New optional request fields or parameters
    * New required request fields that have default values
* Addition of a new value returned for an existing text field
* Changes to the order of fields returned within a response
* Addition of an optional request header
* Removal of redundant request header
* Changes to the length of data returned within a field
* Changes to the overall response size
* Changes to error messages. _We do not recommend parsing error messages to perform business logic. Instead, you should only rely on HTTP response codes and error codes._
* Fixes to HTTP response codes and error codes from incorrect code to correct code
