## Developer Portal Token Inspector

LinkedIn's Developer Portal has a token inspector tool to make token validation as simple as copy and paste. The same Token validation is available through the API or the UI. The [OAuth 2.0 token inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth/token-inspector) is accessible from the developer portal under "Docs and Tools" in the navigation bar.

The tool requires you to select a developer application either from a dropdown or by entering the client ID if you have more than 10 developer applications. Make sure you have created at least one developer application or have been added as an Admin team member to a developer application before using the tool. You may only inspect tokens generated by the selected developer application.

The tool can also be used to generate a curl request to the token introspection endpoint. Simply paste a token in the text box, click "Inspect", and use the "Copy cUrl request" button.
