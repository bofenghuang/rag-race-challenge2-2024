## Error Handling and Logging

### System Outages

Due to the nature of cloud APIs, LinkedIn's services are occasionally interrupted or temporarily unavailable for reasons outside of LinkedIn's control. Assume that any API call you make to LinkedIn or any third party could potentially fail. Always include error-handling logic in your requests. See the [Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/concepts/error-handling?context=linkedin/context) page for API error codes and messages.
