# LinkedIn API Breaking Change Policy

## Overview

As our APIs evolve, LinkedIn will make reasonable efforts to notify you of breaking changes in advance with sufficient time to adapt to these changes.

Important

We may make changes without prior notice if the change is considered non-breaking, or if it is a breaking change being made to address critical product bugs or legal, security, or privacy concerns.

Review this guide carefully to understand what kind of changes we consider to be breaking and non-breaking, and how to ensure that your application can adapt automatically to any change we categorize as non-breaking.
