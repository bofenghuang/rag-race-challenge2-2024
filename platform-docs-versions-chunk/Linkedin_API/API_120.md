## Communication

Please look out for email communication from LinkedIn where we may notify you about breaking and non-breaking changes to our APIs. For breaking change notices, the email notice will usually include the future release date of the breaking change as well as instructions on what actions you need to take. To avoid disruption to your users, ensure that you perform the recommended actions by LinkedIn before the release date of the breaking change.
