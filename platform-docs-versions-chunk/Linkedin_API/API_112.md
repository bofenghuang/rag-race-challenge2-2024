## Access Tokens

Using access tokens, you can access a member's private information through the LinkedIn APIs. To keep access tokens safe:

* Do not store them in insecure or easily accessible locations. Client-side files, such as JavaScript or HTML files, should never be used to store sensitive information, as these can easily be accessed.
* Do not store access tokens in code files that can be decompiled, such as Native iOS, Android, or Windows Application code files.
* When making calls, always pass access tokens over a secure (HTTPS) connection.
