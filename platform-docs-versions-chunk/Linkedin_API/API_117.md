### Third-Party Libraries

When using a third-party library to interact with LinkedIn's APIs, make sure that the library is from a trusted source. Read reviews, look at the code, and do research to make sure the library is not malicious and does not behave unexpectedly.

LinkedIn **does not officially support third-party libraries**. Contact that libraryâ€™s development team if you have technical questions or concerns.
