Integrating with PowerTrack

## Integrating with PowerTrack

To integrate PowerTrack into your product, you will need to build an application that can do the following:

1. Establish a streaming connection to the PowerTrack stream API.
2. Asynchronously send POST requests to the PowerTrack rules API to add and delete rules from the stream.
3. Handle low data volumes – Maintain the streaming connection, and ensure buffers are flushed regularly.
4. Handle high data volumes – de-couple stream ingestion from additional processing using asynchronous processes.
5. Reconnect to the stream automatically when disconnected for any reason.

For details on the types of requests needed for tasks 1 and 2, and important considerations in implementing them, see the [API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/api-reference).
