Enterprise

The Account Activity API provides you the ability to subscribe to realtime activities related to a user account via webhooks. This means that you can receiveÂ realtime Tweets, Direct Messages, and other account events from one or more of your owned or subscribed accounts through a single connection.

You will receive all related activities below for each user subscription on your webhook registration:

| Activity types |     |
| --- | --- |
| * Tweets (by user)  <br>    <br>* Tweet deletes (by user)<br>* @mentions (of user)<br>* Replies (to or from user)<br>* Retweets (by user or of user)<br>* Quote Tweets (by user or of user)<br>* Retweets of Quoted Tweets (by user or of user)<br>* Likes (by user or of user)<br>* Follows (by user or of user)  <br>    <br>* Unfollows (by user) | * Blocks (by user)<br>* Unblocks (by user)<br>* Mutes (by user)<br>* Unmutes (by user)<br>* Direct Messages sent (by user)<br>* Direct Messages received (by user)<br>* Typing indicators (to user)<br>* Read receipts (to user)<br>* Subscription revokes (by user) |

**Please note** - We do not deliver home timeline data via the Account Activity API. Please use the [GET statuses/home\_timeline](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-home_timeline)Â to pull this data.
