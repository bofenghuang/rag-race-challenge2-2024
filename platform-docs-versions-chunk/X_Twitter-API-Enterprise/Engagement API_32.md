###   
Error troubleshooting guide

**I am having problems authenticating**

**I have passed the correct consumer key and secret, as well as access token and access token secret, but the following error is being returned. What can I do?**

    [
        Your account could not be authenticated. Reason: Unknown Authorization Type;
    ]

  
Make sure not to use any access tokens or secrets when you try and authenticate with the /totals endpoint. This is because if you do include these tokens, and are attempting to pull content from a Tweet not associated with these tokens, you will likely receive an error such as:

    [
        Forbidden to access tweets: 1054424731825229824;
