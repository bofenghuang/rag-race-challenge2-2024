## Introduction

With streaming high volumes of realtime Tweets comes a set of best practices that promote both data reliability and data full-fidelity. When consuming realtime data, maximizing your connection time is a fundamental goal. When disconnects occur, it is important to automatically detect that and reconnect. After reconnecting it’s important to assess if there are any periods to backfill data for. The component that manages these details and consumes realtime Tweets is only one part of a system with network, datastore, server, and storage concerns. Given the complexity of these systems, another best practice is to have different streaming environments, with at least separate streams for development/testing and production.

PowerTrack comes with a set of features that help with these efforts.

To support multiple environments, we can deploy [Additional Streams](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/powertrack_recovery_and_redundancy_features#additional_streams) for your account. These streams are completely independent of each other, having unique URLs and separate rule sets.

To help support maintaining a connection, each realtime PowerTrack stream supports [Redundant Connections](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/powertrack_recovery_and_redundancy_features#redundant_connections). The most common architecture is for a stream to have two connections, and on the client-side there are two independent consumers, ideally on different networks. With this design, there can be redundancy across the client-side networks, servers, and datastore pathways. Note that a full-copy of the data is served on each connection (since there is a single ‘source’ server and no partitioning with filtered streams) and the client-side must be tolerant of and manage these duplicate data.

For detecting disconnects, each stream has a ‘heartbeat’ signal that can used to detect when a stream has timed-out. These 10-second heartbeats provide connection confirmation even when there are time periods with no Tweets matching your rules and being delivered on your stream. For most Twitter stream consumers, the data volumes are high enough that even a smaller duration of no Tweets is a sign of a connection issue. So both a ‘data silence’ and lack of a heartbeat can be used to detect a disconnect.

Since disconnects will happen, PowerTrack has a dedicated [Recovery](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/powertrack_recovery_and_redundancy_features#replay) and a PowerTrack [Backfill](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/powertrack-api/guides/powertrack_recovery_and_redundancy_features#backfill) feature to help recover data that was missed due to disconnections and other operational issues.
