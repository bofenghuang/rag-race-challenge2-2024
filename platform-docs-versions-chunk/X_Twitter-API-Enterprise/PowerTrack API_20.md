### Test backoff strategies

A good way to test a backoff implementation is to use invalid authorization credentials and examine the reconnect attempts. A good implementation will not get any 420 responses.

### Issue alerts for multiple reconnects

If a client reaches its upper threshold of its time between reconnects, it should send you notifications so you can triage the issues affecting your connection.

### Handle DNS changes

Test that your client process honors the DNS Time To live (TTL). Some stacks will cache a resolved address for the duration of the process and will not pick up DNS changes within the proscribed TTL. Such aggressive caching will lead to service disruptions on your client as Twitter shifts load between IP addresses.

### User Agent

Ensure your user-agent HTTP header includes the client’s version. This will be critical in diagnosing issues on Twitter’s end. If your environment precludes setting the user-agent field, then set an x-user-agent header.
