### Data Dictionary

Below you will find the data dictionary for these ‚Äòroot-level‚Äô "activity" attributes, as well as links to child object data dictionaries.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | Type | Description |
| id  | string | A unique IRI for the tweet. In more detail, "tag" is the scheme, "search.twitter.com" represents the domain for the scheme, and 2005 is when the scheme was derived.  <br>When storing Tweets, this should be used as the unique identifier or primary key.  <br>"id": "tag:search.twitter.com,2005:1050118621198921728" |
| objectType | string | Type of object, always set to "activity"  <br>"objectType": "activity" |
| object | object | An object representing tweet being posted or shared.  <br>For Retweets, this will contain an entire "activity", with the pertinent fields described in this schema.  <br>For Original Tweets, this will contain a "note" object, with the fields described here.  <br>"object":  <br>"object": {  <br>"objectType": "note",  <br>"id": "object:search.twitter.com,2005:1050118621198921728",  <br>"summary": "To make room for more expression, we will now count all emojis as equal‚Äîincluding those with gender‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç ‚Äç‚Äçand skin t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/MkGjXf9aXm",  <br>"link": "http://twitter.com/TwitterAPI/statuses/1050118621198921728",  <br>"postedTime": "2018-10-10T20:19:24.000Z"  <br>} |
| long\_object | object | An object representing the full text body if the Tweet text extends beyond 140 characters.  <br>  <br>  <br>"long\_object": {  <br>"body": "To make room for more expression, we will now count all emojis as equal‚Äîincluding those with gender‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç ‚Äç‚Äçand skin tone modifiers üëçüèªüëçüèΩüëçüèø.

| display\_text\_range | array | if the Tweet text extends beyond 140 characters.  <br>  <br>  <br>"display\_text\_range": \[  <br>0,  <br>142  <br>\] |
| verb | string | [The type of action being taken by the user.  <br>Tweets, "post"  <br>Retweets, "share"  <br>Deleted Tweets, "delete"  <br>The verb is the proper way to distinguish between a Tweet and a true Retweet. However, this only applies to true retweets, and not modified or quoted Tweets, which don't use Twitter's Retweet functionality. For a description of AS verbs](http://activitystrea.ms/head/activity-schema.html#verbs) [click here](http://activitystrea.ms/head/activity-schema.html#verbs).  <br>For Deletes, note that only a limited number of fields will be included, as shown in the sample payload below.  <br>"verb": "post" |
| postedTime | date (ISO 8601) | The time the action occurred, e.g. the time the Tweet was posted.  <br>  <br>  <br>"postedTime": "2018-10-10T20:19:24.000Z" |
| generator | object | An object representing the utility used to post the Tweet. This will contain the name ("displayName") and a link ("link") for the source application generating the Tweet.  <br>"generator": {  <br>"displayName": "Twitter Web Client",  <br>"link": "http://twitter.com"  <br>} |
| provider | object | A JSON object representing the provider of the activity. This will contain an objectType ("service"), the name of the provider ("displayName"), and a link to the provider's website ("link").  <br>"provider":  <br>{  <br>"objectType": "service",  <br>"displayName": "Twitter",  <br>"link": "http://www.twitter.com"  <br>} |
| link | string | A Permalink for the tweet.  <br>"link": "http://twitter.com/TwitterAPI/statuses/1050118621198921728" |
| body | string | The tweet text.  <br>  <br>In Retweets, note that Twitter modifies the value of the body at the root level by adding "RT @username" at the beginning, and by truncating the original text and adding an ellipsis at the end. Thus, for Retweets, your app should look at the object.body to ensure that it is extracting the non-modified text of the original Tweet (being retweeted).  <br>"body": "With Cardiff, Crystal Palace, and Hull City joining the EPL from the Championship it will be a great relegation battle at the end." |
| display\_text\_range | array | Describes the range of characters within the body text that indicates the displayed Tweet. Tweets with leading @mentions will start at more than 0 and Tweets with attached media or that extened beyond 140 characters will indicate the display\_text\_range in the long\_object.  <br>  <br>"display\_text\_range": \[  <br>14,  <br>42  <br>\]  <br>or  <br>"long\_object": {  <br>"display\_text\_range": \[  <br>0,  <br>277  <br>\]... |
| actor | object | [An object representing the twitter user who tweeted. The Actor Object refers to a Twitter User, and contains all metadata relevant to that user.  <br>See](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/actor.html) [actor object details](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/actor.html) |
| inReplyTo | object | A JSON object referring to the Tweet being replied to, if applicable. Contains a link to the Tweet.  <br>"inReplyTo":  <br>{  <br>"link": "http:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/GOP\\/statuses\\/349573991561838593"  <br>} |
| location | object | [A JSON object representing the Twitter "Place" where the tweet was created. This is an object passed through from the Twitter platform.  <br>  <br>See](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/location.html) [location object](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/location.html) |
| twitter\_entities | object | The entities object from Twitter's data format which contains lists of urls, mentions and hashtags. Please reference the Twitter documentation on Entities here Note that in Retweets, Twitter may truncate the values of entities that it extracts at the root level. So, for Retweets, your app should look at object.twitter\_entities to ensure that you are using non-truncated values.  <br>  <br>See twitter\_entities object details |
| twitter\_extended\_entities | object | An object from Twitter's native data format containing "media". This will be present for any Tweet where the twitter\_entities object has data present in the "media" field, and will include multiple photos where present in the post. Note that this is the correct location to retrieve media information for multi-photo posts.  <br>  <br>Multiple photos are represented by comma-separated JSON objects within the "media" array.  <br>  <br>See [twitter\_extended\_entities object details](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/twitter-extended-entities.html) |
| gnip | object | An object added to the activity payload to indicate the matching rules, and added enriched data based on enrichments active on the stream or product.  <br>  <br>See [gnip object details](https://aem.twitter.biz/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/activity-streams-objects/gnip.html) |
| edit\_history | Object | Unique identifiers indicating all versions of a Tweet. For Tweets with no edits, there will be one ID. For Tweets with an edit history, there will be multiple IDs, arranged in ascending order reflecting the order of edits, with the most recent version in the last position of the array.¬†<br><br>The Tweet IDs can be used to hydrate and view previous versions of a Tweet.<br><br>Example:<br><br>edit\_history": {<br>    "initial\_tweet\_id": "1283764123"<br>    "edit\_tweet\_ids": \["1283764123", "1394263866"\]<br>  } |
| edit\_controls | Object | When present, indicates how long a Tweet is still editable for and the number of remaining edits. Tweets are only editable for the first 30 minutes after creation and can be edited up to five times.¬†<br><br>The Tweet IDs can be used to hydrate and view previous versions of a Tweet.<br><br>Example:<br><br>"edit\_controls": {  <br>     "editable\_until\_ms": 123<br>     "edits\_remaining": 3   <br>  } |
| editable | Boolean | When present, indicates if a Tweet was eligible for edit when published. This field is not dynamic and won't toggle from True to False when a Tweet reaches its editable time limit, or maximum number of edits. The following Tweet features will cause this field to be false:<br><br>* Tweets is promoted<br>* Tweet has a poll<br>* Tweet is a non-self-thread reply<br>* Tweet is a retweet (note that Quote Tweets are eligible for edit)<br>* Tweet is nullcast<br>* Community Tweet<br>* Superfollow Tweet<br>* Collaborative Tweet |
