### Limitations

Replay is intended as a tool for easily recovering activities as far back as five days ago, but it will not deliver events prior to a subscriptionâ€™s creation time. For example, if three days ago, you added a new subscription and ran a Replay job with a window for five days prior to today, you would only receive data for the three days that this new subscription was active.
