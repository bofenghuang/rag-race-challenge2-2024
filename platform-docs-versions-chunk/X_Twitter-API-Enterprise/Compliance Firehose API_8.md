## Integrating with the Compliance Firehose

To integrate the Compliance Firehose into your system, you will need to build an integration that can do the following:

1. Establish a streaming connection to each streaming API partition of the Compliance Firehose
2. Handle high data volumes â€“ de-couple stream ingestion from additional processing using asynchronous processes
3. Reconnect to the stream partitions automatically when disconnected for any reason
4. Process compliance events that are relevant to Tweet and User data you have stored in accordance with the guidance presented above
