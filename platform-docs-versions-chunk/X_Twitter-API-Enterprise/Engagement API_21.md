## Recent changes to the Engagement API

The Engagement API delivers invaluable impression and engagement metrics that enable you to monitor the performance of your activity on Twitter. In our continual effort to enable marketing decisions based on our data, we are excited to share recent changes to the Engagement API that provide greater consistency with metrics across all of Twitter.  

We recently deployed changes to modernize the Engagement API to use the same metrics aggregation methodology in use by the Twitter analytics dashboard (analytics.twitter.com). We took a thoughtful approach to try and minimize breaking API changes when rolling out these new metrics and deployed the first set of changes on October 9, 2017. These changes improve consistency from all of the places you or your customers might monitor your performance on Twitter. Please see the detailed outline of the changes below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Metric** | **Change** |
| engagements | We’ve updated the metrics that roll into overall engagements to match consistency with the Tweet analytics dashboard. Engagements measures “times people interacted with this Tweet”.<br><br>For Tweets that include media like a video or a GIF, the engagements metric will no longer include media views. Media views can now be accessed in a new metric, _media\_views_. |
| media\_clicks\* | This metric has been replaced by a new metric called “_media\_engagements_”. |
| video\_views | As of July 6th, 2018, this metric is now available for 'unowned' Tweets via the [/totals](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/metrics/get-tweet-engagement/api-reference/post-insights-engagement#Totals) endpoint. This means that you can access the video views for **all** Tweets by using app-only authentication. <br><br>You can only request video views that are younger than 1800 days old. If you try to request video views for a Tweet older than 1800 days, you will receive the following:<br><br>"unsupported\_for\_video\_views\_tweet\_ids": \["TWEET\_ID"\]<br><br>**Please note** that it will differ from media\_views in that video\_views relies on the MRC standard of 50% of the video in view for at least two seconds.  <br><br>**Also,** note that you may see a discrepancy between the video views metric displayed in the Twitter owned and operated platforms (mobile app and website) and the number that you receive via the /28hr and /historical endpoints.<br><br>* The video views displayed in the Twitter user interface and that delivers using the /totals endpoint will display the video view aggregated across all Tweets in which the given video has been posted. That means that the metric displayed in the UI includes the combined views from any instance where the video has been Retweeted or reposted in separate Tweets.<br>* The video views provided by the /28hr and /historical endpoints will just include those views generated by the specific Tweet for which you are pulling metrics. |
| media\_views | This includes all views (autoplay and click) of your media counted across videos, vines, gifs, and images.<br><br>**Please note** that Tweets with images do not show a media\_views metric in the analytics dashboard but will be returned in the Engagement API. |
| media\_engagements\* | This includes the number of clicks on your media across videos, vines, gifs, and images. This metric is replacing _media\_clicks_. |
| quote\_tweets | As of July 7th, 2020, this metric is now available for 'unowned' Tweets via the /totals endpoint. This means that you can access the Quote Tweet count for all Tweets by using app-only authentication. |
