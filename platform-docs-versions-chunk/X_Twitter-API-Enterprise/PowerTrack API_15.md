## Disconnections

Twitter will close a streaming connection for the following reasons:

* A client establishes too many connections with the same credentials. When this occurs, the oldest connection will be terminated. This means you have to be careful not to run two reconnecting clients in parallel with the same credentials, or else they will take turns disconnecting each other.
* A client stops reading data suddenly. If the rate of Tweets being read off of the stream drops suddenly, the connection will be closed.
* A client reads data too slowly. Every streaming connection is backed by a queue of messages to be sent to the client. If this queue grows too large over time, the connection will be closed.
* A streaming server is restarted. This is usually related to a code deploy and is not very frequent.
* Twitterâ€™s network configuration changes. These events are rare, and would represent load balancer restarts or network reconfigurations, for example.
