## Entities object

The `entities` and `extended_entities` sections are both made up of arrays of entity _objects_. Below you will find descriptions for each of these entity objects, including data dictionaries that describe the object attribute names, types, and short description. Weâ€™ll also indicate which PowerTrack Operators match these attributes, and include some sample JSON payloads.

A collection of common entities found in Tweets, including hashtags, links, and user mentions. This `entities` object does include a `media` attribute, but its implementation in the `entiites` section is only completely accurate for Tweets with a single photo. For all Tweets with more than one photo, a video, or animated GIF, the reader is directed to the `extended_entities` section.
