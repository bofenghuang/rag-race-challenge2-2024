Activity retries

## Retries

Enterprise

One of the benefits of the enterprise tier of the Account Activity API is a retry mechanism for webhook events. If a 'success' 200 HTTP response code is not received, the Twitter server will initiate a retry mechanism, resending the webhook event up to three times over a five-minute period. This webhook event retry service helps provide reliability and event recovery when networkÂ problems occur and during client-side service interruptions and deploys.
