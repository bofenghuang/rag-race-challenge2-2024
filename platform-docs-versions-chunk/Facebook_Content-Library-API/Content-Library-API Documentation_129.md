## Initial testing

We expect our methodology to measure search quality to evolve over time. Here we outline a set of initial tests of search quality in the Meta Content Library and API. The systems which underlie search are complex and the data models as well as privacy rules which determine content visibility evolve over time, meaning that quality regressions can occur. Furthermore, as we develop the product, we welcome feedback about bugs or unexpected behavior from the user community. See [Appendix](#appendix) on this page for details on reporting issues.
