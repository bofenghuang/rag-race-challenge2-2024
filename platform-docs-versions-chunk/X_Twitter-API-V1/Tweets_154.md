# GET collections/entries

Retrieve the identified Collection, presented as a list of the Tweets curated within.

The response structure of this method differs significantly from timelines you may be used to working with elsewhere in the Twitter API.

To navigate a Collection, use the position object of a response, which includes attributes for `max_position`, `min_position`, and `was_truncated`. `was_truncated` indicates whether additional Tweets exist in the collection outside of the range of the current request. To retrieve Tweets further back in time, use the value of `min_position` found in the current response as the `max_position` parameter in the next call to this endpoint.
