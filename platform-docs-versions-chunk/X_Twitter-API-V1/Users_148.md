| Name | Required | Description | Default Value | Example |
| list\_id | required | The numerical _id_ of the list. |     |     |
| slug | required | You can identify a list by its slug instead of its numerical id. If you decide to do so, note that you'll also have to specify the list owner using the _owner\_id_ or _owner\_screen\_name_ parameters. |     |     |
| owner\_screen\_name | optional | The screen name of the user who owns the list being requested by a _slug_ . |     |     |
| owner\_id | optional | The user ID of the user who owns the list being requested by a _slug_ . |     |     |
| count | optional | Specifies the number of results to return per page (see _cursor_ below). The default is 20, with a maximum of 5,000. |     |     |
| cursor | optional | Breaks the results into pages. A single page contains 20 lists. Provide a value of _\-1_ to begin paging.
