## Connecting

To connect to the Streaming API, form a HTTP request and consume the resulting stream for as long as is practical. Our servers will hold the connection open indefinitely, barring server-side error, excessive client-side lag, network hiccups, routine server maintenance or duplicate logins.

The method to form an HTTP request and parse the response will be different for every language or framework, so consult the documentation for the HTTP library you are using.

Some HTTP client libraries only return the response body after the connection has been closed by the server. These clients will not work for accessing the Streaming API. You must use an HTTP client that will return response data incrementally. Most robust HTTP client libraries will provide this functionality. The [Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) will handle this use case, for example.
