## 

In general these `user` metadata values are relatively constant. Some fields never change, such as the user's `id` (provided as a string `id_str`) and when the account was created. Other metadata can occasionally change, such as the `screen_name`, display`name`, `description`, `location`, and other profile details. Some metadata frequently changes, such as the number of Tweets the account has posted `statuses_count`Â and its number of followers `followers_count`.
