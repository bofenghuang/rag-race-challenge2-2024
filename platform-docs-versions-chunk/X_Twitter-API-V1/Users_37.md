## Parameters[Â¶](#parameters "Permalink to this headline")

| Name | Required | Description | Default Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stringify\_ids | optional | Many programming environments will not consume Twitter IDs due to their size. Provide this option to have IDs returned as strings instead. Read more about [Twitter IDs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids) . |     | `true` |
| cursor | semi-optional | Causes the list of IDs to be broken into pages of no more than 5000 IDs at a time. The number of IDs returned is not guaranteed to be 5000 as suspended users are filtered out after connections are queried. If no cursor is provided, a value of `-1` will be assumed, which is the first "page."<br><br>The response from the API will include a `previous_cursor` and `next_cursor` to allow paging back and forth. See [Using cursors to navigate collections](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/cursoring) for more information. | `-1` | `12893764510938` |
