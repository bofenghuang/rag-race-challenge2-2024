## 

The Twitter API has several methods, such as [GET statuses / user\_timeline](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-user_timeline.html) and [GET statuses / home\_timeline](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-home_timeline.html), which return a timeline of Tweet data. Such timelines can grow very large, so there are limits to how much of a timeline a client application may fetch in a single request. Applications must therefore iterate through timeline results in order to build a more complete list.

Because of Twitter’s realtime nature and the volume of data which is constantly being added to timelines, standard paging approaches are not always effective. The goal of this page is to demonstrate the issues Twitter developers may face when paging through result sets and to give best practices for processing a timeline.
