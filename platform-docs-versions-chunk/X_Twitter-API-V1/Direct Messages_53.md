# POST direct\_messages/welcome\_messages/rules/new

Creates a new Welcome Message Rule that determines which Welcome Message will be shown in a given conversation. Returns the created rule if successful.

Requires a JSON POST body and `Content-Type` header to be set to `application/json`. Setting `Content-Length` may also be required if it is not automatically.

Additional rule configurations are forthcoming. For the initial beta release, the most recently created Rule will always take precedence, and the assigned Welcome Message will be displayed in the conversation.

See the [Welcome Messages overview](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/welcome-messages/overview) to learn how to work with Welcome Messages.
