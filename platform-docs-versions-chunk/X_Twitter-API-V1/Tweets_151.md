# Response Structures

The Collections API responds with data structures that often depart from the objects you traditionally encounter in the Twitter API.

In the Collections API, all identifiers (IDs, cursors, collection positions) are presented as strings. These strings are safe to consume and utilize in all programming languages, including those that do not support 64-bit integers.

While representations of [Tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets) and [Users](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/users) generally match other Twitter API representations, watch for minor differences in the object structure, especially around data related to counts.

While the API typically returns objects-embedded-within-objects (such as the author of a Tweet being embedded within the Tweet itself), these API methods provide decomposed responses where each object type is grouped together and each object is represented only once. Instead of containing associated child objects, the objects contain simple ID references to the association.

Here are some of the response structures you will encounter in the Collections API.
