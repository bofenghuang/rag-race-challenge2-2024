\[1\] This column was previously labeled "Accounts Impacted", but we changed the name to clarify that it reflects the number of accounts subject to the data requests, and not the number of accounts for which some responsive data was in fact provided.

  
\[2\] We started reporting the number of accounts for which at least some data was provided in response to government requests in our January-June 2014 Transparency Report.
