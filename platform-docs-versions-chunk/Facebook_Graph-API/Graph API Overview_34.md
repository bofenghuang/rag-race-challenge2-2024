### Dashboard

The [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) displays the number of rate limited app users, the appâ€™s current Application Rate Limits usage percentage, and displays average activity for the past 7 days. In the **Application Rate Limit** card, click **View Details** and hover over any point on the graph to see more details about usage for that particular moment. Because usage depends on call volume, this graph may not show a full 7 days. Apps with a higher volume of calls will show more days.
