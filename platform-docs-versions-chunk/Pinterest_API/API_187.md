## [](#operation/feeds/create)Create feed

Create a new feed owned by the "operation user\_account".

* By default, the "operation user\_account" is the token user\_account.

Please, be aware that "default\_country" and "default\_locale" are not required in the spec for forward compatibility but for now the API will not accept requests without those fields.

Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad\_account as the "operation user\_account". In order to do this, the token user\_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad\_account: Owner, Admin, Catalogs Manager.

For Retail partners, refer to [Before you get started with Catalogs](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/before-you-get-started-with-catalogs). For Hotel parterns, refer to [Pinterest API for shopping](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/shopping/catalog/).
