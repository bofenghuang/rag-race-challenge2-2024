## [](#operation/products_by_product_group_filter/list)List filtered products

List products Pins owned by the "operation user\_account" that meet the criteria specified in the Catalogs Product Group Filter given in the request.

* This endpoint has been implemented in POST to allow for complex filters. This specific POST endpoint is designed to be idempotent.
* By default, the "operation user\_account" is the token user\_account.

Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad\_account as the "operation user\_account". In order to do this, the token user\_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad\_account: Owner, Admin, Catalogs Manager.
