## [](#operation/pins/save)Save Pin

Save a Pin on a board or board section owned by the "operation user\_account".

* By default, the "operation user\_account" is the token user\_account. Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad\_account as the "operation user\_account". In order to do this, the token user\_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad\_account:
    
* For Pins on public or protected boards: Owner, Admin, Analyst, Campaign Manager.
    
* For Pins on secret boards: Owner, Admin.
    
* Any Pin type can be saved: image Pin, video Pin, Idea Pin, product Pin, etc.
    
* Any public Pin can be saved given a pin ID.
