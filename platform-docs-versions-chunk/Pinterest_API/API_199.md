## [](#operation/feed_processing_results/list)List processing results for a given feed

Fetch a feed processing results owned by the "operation user\_account". Please note that for now the bookmark parameter is not functional and only the first page will be available until it is implemented in some release in the near future.

* By default, the "operation user\_account" is the token user\_account.

Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad\_account as the "operation user\_account". In order to do this, the token user\_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad\_account: Owner, Admin, Catalogs Manager.
