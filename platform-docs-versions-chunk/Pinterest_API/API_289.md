| interests | Array of strings (Interest)<br><br>Items Enum: "animals" "architecture" "art" "beauty" "childrens\_fashion" "design" "diy\_and\_crafts" "education" "electronics" "entertainment" "event\_planning" "finance" "food\_and\_drinks" "gardening" "health" "home\_decor" "mens\_fashion" "parenting" "quotes" "sport" â€¦ 4 more<br><br>Example: interests=beauty&interests=womens\_fashion<br><br>If set, filters the results to trends associated with the specified interests.  <br>If unset, trends for all interests will be returned.  <br>The list of supported interests is:<br><br>* `animals` - Animals<br>* `architecture` - Architecture<br>* `art` - Art<br>* `beauty` - Beauty<br>* `childrens_fashion` - Children's Fashion<br>* `design` - Design<br>* `diy_and_crafts` - DIY & Crafts<br>* `education` - Education<br>* `electronics` - Electronics<br>* `entertainment` - Entertainment<br>* `event_planning` - Event Planning<br>* `finance` - Finance<br>* `food_and_drinks` - Food & Drink<br>* `gardening` - Gardening<br>* `health` - Health<br>* `home_decor` - Home Decor<br>* `mens_fashion` - Men's Fashion<br>* `parenting` - Parenting<br>* `quotes` - Quotes<br>* `sport` - Sports<br>* `travel` - Travel<br>* `vehicles` - Vehicles<br>* `wedding` - Wedding<br>* `womens_fashion` - Women's Fashion |
| genders | Array of strings (Gender)<br><br>Items Enum: "female" "male" "unknown"<br><br>Example: genders=female&genders=unknown<br><br>If set, filters the results to trends among users who identify with the specified gender(s).  <br>If unset, trends among all genders will be returned.  <br>The `unknown` group includes users with unspecified or customized gender profile settings. |
| ages | Array of strings (AgeRange)<br><br>Items Enum: "18-24" "25-34" "35-44" "45-49" "50-54" "55-64" "65+"<br><br>Example: ages=35-44&ages=50-54<br><br>If set, filters the results to trends among users in the specified age range(s).  <br>If unset, trends among all age groups will be returned. |
| normalize\_against\_group | boolean<br><br>Default: false<br><br>Example: normalize\_against\_group=true<br><br>Governs how the resulting time series data will be normalized to a \[0-100\] scale.  <br>By default (`false`), the data will be normalized independently for each keyword. The peak search volume observation in _each_ keyword's time series will be represented by the value 100. This is ideal for analyzing when an individual keyword is expected to peak in interest.  <br>If set to `true`, the data will be normalized as a group. The peak search volume observation across _all_ keywords in the response will be represented by the value 100, and all other values scaled accordingly. Use this option when you wish to compare relative search volume between multiple keywords. |
| limit | integer \[ 1 .. 50 \]<br><br>Default: 50<br><br>Example: limit=25<br><br>The maximum number of trending keywords that will be returned. Keywords are returned in trend-ranked order, so a `limit` of 50 will return the top 50 trends. |
