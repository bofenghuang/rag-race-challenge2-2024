## [](#operation/customer_lists/update)Update customer list

Append or remove records to/from an existing customer list. (A customer list is one of the four types of Pinterest audiences.)

When you add records to an existing customer list, the system scans the additions for existing Pinterest accounts; those are the records that will be added to your “CUSTOMER\_LIST” audience. Your original list of records to add will be deleted when the matching process is complete.

For more information, see [Audience targeting](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-targeting) or the [Audiences](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/ads/targeting/#Audiences) section of the ads management guide.
