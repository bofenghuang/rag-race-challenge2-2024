## [](#operation/ad_accounts/create)Create ad account

Create a new ad account. Different ad accounts can support different currencies, payment methods, etc. An ad account is needed to create campaigns, ad groups, and ads; other accounts (your employees or partners) can be assigned business access and appropriate roles to access an ad account.

You can set up up to 50 ad accounts per user. (The user must have a business account to create an ad account.)
