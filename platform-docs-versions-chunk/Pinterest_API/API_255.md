## [](#operation/customer_lists/create)Create customer lists

Create a customer list from your records(hashed or plain-text email addresses, or hashed MAIDs or IDFAs).

A customer list is one of the four types of Pinterest audiences: for more information, see [Audience targeting](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-targeting) or the [Audiences](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/ads/targeting/#Audiences) section of the ads management guide.

**Please review our [requirements](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-targeting#section-13341) for what type of information is allowed when uploading a customer list.**

When you create a customer list, the system scans the list for existing Pinterest accounts; the list must include at least 100 Pinterest accounts. Your original list will be deleted when the matching process is complete. The filtered list – containing only the Pinterest accounts that were included in your starting list – is what will be used to create the audience.

Note that once you have created your customer list, you must convert it into an audience (of the “ CUSTOMER\_LIST” type) using the [create audience endpoint](#operation/create_audience_handler) before it can be used.
