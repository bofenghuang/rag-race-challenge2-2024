## [](#operation/pins/analytics)Get Pin analytics

Get analytics for a Pin owned by the "operation user\_account" - or on a group board that has been shared with this account.

* By default, the "operation user\_account" is the token user\_account.

Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad\_account as the "operation user\_account". In order to do this, the token user\_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad\_account:

* For Pins on public or protected boards: Admin, Analyst.
* For Pins on secret boards: Admin.

If Pin was created before `2023-03-20` lifetime metrics will only be available for Video and Idea Pin formats. Lifetime metrics are available for all Pin formats since then.
