### Integrate an endpoint into your system

To make your integration with our endpoints seamless, we have built out a set of tools, libraries, and integration guides. The easiest way to integrate is to use our [tools and libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tools-and-libraries), which automatically handle complex functionality such as [OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a), pagination, and [rate limit handling](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/rate-limits). 

If you would rather build a solution from the ground up, our endpoint integration guides describe the functionality and best practices around integrating our endpoints into your system. These guides can be found in the different endpoint and tool documentation, listed as ‘integrate’ or simply ‘guides’. For example, here is an integration guide on [how to build a rule for the Filter stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule).
