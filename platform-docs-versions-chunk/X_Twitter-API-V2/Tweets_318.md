Introduction

## Introduction

Retweeting is one of the core features people use to engage in the public conversation on Twitter. With the Retweets lookup endpoints, you can see a list of accounts that Retweeted a given Tweet. In addition, the new manage Retweets endpoints allow you to Retweet a Tweet or undo a Retweet.

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) that is located within a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects). 

Learn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our [getting started guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).
