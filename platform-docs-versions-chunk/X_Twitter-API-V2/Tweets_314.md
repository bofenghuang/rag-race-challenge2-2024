### Query parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `partition`  <br> Required | integer | Must be set to 1 or 2. The 10% sampled stream is split into 2 partitions, each requiring their own connection request. Use this parameter to specify which partition you are connecting to. |
| `backfill_minutes`  <br> Optional | integer | By passing this parameter, you can request up to five (5) minutes worth of streaming data that you might have missed during a disconnection to be delivered to you upon reconnection. The backfilled Tweets will automatically flow through the reconnected stream, with older Tweets generally being delivered before any newly matching Tweets. You must include a whole number between 1 and 5 as the value to this parameter.  <br>  <br>This feature will deliver duplicate Tweets, meaning that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, and you requested two minutes of backfill, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Tweets. Due to this, you should make sure your system is tolerant of duplicate data.  <br>  <br>This feature is currently only available to those that have been approved for Academic Research access. To learn more about this access level, please visit our section on [Academic Research](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research). |
| `end_time`  <br> Optional | date (ISO 8601) | Used to initiate a stream for recovering missing data from the previous 24 hours. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Requires Enterprise access. Used with `start_time` to indicate period of missing data. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes the first second of the minute). |
| `expansions`  <br> Optional | enum (`attachments.poll_ids`, `attachments.media_keys`, `author_id`, `edit_history_tweet_ids`, `entities.mentions.username`, `geo.place_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `referenced_tweets.id`, `referenced_tweets.id.author_id`) | [Expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the Tweet data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the `includes` response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object.  <br>  <br>The following data objects can be expanded using this parameter:  <br><br>* The Tweet author's user object<br>* The user object of the Tweet’s author that the original Tweet is responding to<br>* Any mentioned users’ object<br>* Any referenced Tweets’ author’s user object<br>* Attached media’s object<br>* Attached poll’s object<br>* Attached place’s object<br>* Any referenced Tweets’ object (this includes Tweet objects for previous versions of an edited Tweet) |
| `media.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`duration_ms`, `height`, `media_key`, `preview_image_url`, `type`, `url`, `width`, `public_metrics`, `alt_text`, `variants`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [media fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/media) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media and if you've also included the `expansions=attachments.media_keys` query parameter in your request. While the media ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional media fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `place.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`contained_within`, `country`, `country_code`, `full_name`, `geo`, `id`, `name`, `place_type`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [place fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/place) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return place fields if the Tweet contains a place and if you've also included the `expansions=geo.place_id` query parameter in your request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional place fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `poll.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`duration_minutes`, `end_datetime`, `id`, `options`, `voting_status`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [poll fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/poll) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if you've also included the `expansions=attachments.poll_ids` query parameter in your request. While the poll ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional poll fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `start_time`  <br> Optional | date (ISO 8601) | Used to initiate a stream for recovering missing data from the previous 24 hours. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Requires Enterprise access. Used with `end_time` to indicate period of missing data. The oldest UTC timestamp from which the Tweets will be recovered. Timestamp is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example, 12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). |
| `tweet.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`attachments`, `author_id`, `context_annotations`, `conversation_id`, `created_at`, `edit_controls`, `entities`, `geo`, `id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `lang`, `public_metrics`, `possibly_sensitive`, `referenced_tweets`, `reply_settings`, `source`, `text`, `withheld`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [Tweet fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) will deliver in each returned Tweet object. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. You can also pass the `expansions=referenced_tweets.id` expansion to return the specified fields for both the original Tweet and any included referenced Tweets. The requested Tweet fields will display in both the original Tweet data object, as well as in the referenced Tweet expanded data object that will be located in the `includes` data object. |
| `user.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`created_at`, `description`, `entities`, `id`, `location`, `most_recent_tweet_id`, `name`, `pinned_tweet_id`, `profile_image_url`, `protected`, `public_metrics`, `url`, `username`, `verified`, `verified_type`, `withheld`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [user fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. While the user ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional user fields in the `includes` data object.  <br>  <br>You must also pass one of the user expansions to return the desired user fields:  <br><br>* `expansions=author_id`<br>* `expansions=entities.mentions.username`<br>* `expansions=in_reply_to_user_id`<br>* `expansions=referenced_tweets.id.author_id` |
