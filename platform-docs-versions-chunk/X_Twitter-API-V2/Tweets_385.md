Introduction

## Introduction

Liking Tweets is one of the core features people use to engage in the public conversation onÂ  Twitter. With endpoints in our Likes lookup endpoint group, you can see a list of accounts that have liked a given Tweet, or which Tweets a given account has liked. You could use these endpoints to understand what kind of content a specified account or group of accounts likes.
