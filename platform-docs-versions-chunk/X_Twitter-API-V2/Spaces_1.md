Spaces overview

## Introduction

The following page describes the Spaces endpoints included in the Twitter API. To learn more about Spaces in general, please visit [help.twitter.com](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces).Â 

Spaces allow expression and interaction via live audio conversation. The Spaces endpoints provide the tools to create new functionality around Spaces. You can use these endpoints to lookup live or scheduled Spaces, or to build discovery experiences to give your users ways to find Spaces they may be interested in.

We encourage you to use your creativity to extend Spaces beyond the way we built it. With these endpoints you can build experiences to suggest Spaces to listeners based on keywords present in the title, or by surfacing accounts who host live or upcoming Spaces and are followed by a user; you can also help Hosts better understand how their Spaces are performing and get more insights on their audience.
