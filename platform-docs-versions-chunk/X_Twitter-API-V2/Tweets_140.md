### Operators

**Operator**[Type](#type)[Availability](#availability)DescriptionkeywordStandaloneEssentialMatches a keyword within the body of a Tweet. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.  
  
For example, a Tweet with the text ‚ÄúI like coca-cola‚Äù would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.  
  
Example: pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"emojiStandaloneEssentialMatches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.  
  
Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.  
  
Example: (üòÉ OR üò°) üò¨"exact phrase match"StandaloneEssentialMatches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.  
  
Example: ("Twitter API" OR #v2) -"recent search"#StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet.  
  
This operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule #thanku will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.  
  
Example: #thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande@StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).  
  
Example: (@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter$StandaloneElevatedMatches any Tweet that contains the specified ‚Äòcashtag‚Äô (where the leading character of the token is the ‚Äò$‚Äô character).  
  
Note that the cashtag operator relies on Twitter‚Äôs ‚Äòsymbols‚Äô entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.  
  
Example: $twtr OR @twitterdev -$fbfrom:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet from a specific user.  
The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.  
  
You can only pass a single username/ID per from: operator.  
  
Example: from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitterto:StandaloneEssentialMatches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user.  
The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.  
  
You can only pass a single username/ID per to: operator.  
  
Example: to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitterurl:StandaloneEssentialPerforms a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.  
  
This operator can matches on the contents of both the url or expanded\_url fields. For example, a Tweet containing "You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:  
  
from:TwitterDev url:"https://developer.twitter.com"  
(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.expanded\_url)  
  
from:TwitterDev url:"https://t.co"  
(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.url)  
  
Tokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, url:"/developer"). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, url:"https://developer.twitter.com").retweets\_of:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.  
  
You can only pass a single username/ID per retweets\_of: operator.  
  
Example: retweets\_of:twitterdev OR retweets\_of:twitterapi

You can only pass a single domain/entity per context: operator.  
  
context:domain\_id.entity\_id  

However, you can combine multiple domain/entities using the OR operator:

`(context:47.1139229372198469633 OR context:11.1088514520308342784)`

Examples:  
context:10.799022225751871488

conversation\_id:StandaloneEssentialMatches Tweets that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Tweet ID of a Tweet that started a conversation. As Replies to a Tweet are posted, even Replies to Replies, the conversation\_id is added to its JSON payload.  
  
You can only pass a single conversation ID per conversation\_id: operator.  
  
Example: conversation\_id:1334987486343299072 (from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi)list:StandaloneElevated

**NEW**¬†Matches Tweets posted by users who are members of a specified list.¬†

For example, if @twitterdev and @twitterapi were members of List 123, and you included list:123 in your query, your response will only contain Tweets that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the [List lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/lists/lists-lookup) endpoint.

**Please note**¬†that you can only use a single list: operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per list: operator.

Example: list:123

place:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets tagged with the specified location or Twitter place ID. Multi-word place names (‚ÄúNew York City‚Äù, ‚ÄúPalo Alto‚Äù) should be enclosed in quotes.  
  
You can only pass a single place per place: operator.  
  
Note: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain Twitter place IDs.  
  
Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Tweet. It will also not match on places attached to the original Tweet of a Quote Tweet.  
  
Example: place:"new york city" OR place:seattle OR place:fd70c22040963ac7place\_country:StandaloneElevatedMatches Tweets where the country code associated with a tagged place/location matches the given ISO alpha-2 character code.

Example: recommend #paris has:geo -bakerylang:Conjunction requiredEssentialMatches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the Tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so AND‚Äôing together multiple languages will yield no results.
