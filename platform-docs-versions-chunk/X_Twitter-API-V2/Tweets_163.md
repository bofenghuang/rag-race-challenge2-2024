### Query parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query`  <br> Required | string | One query for matching Tweets. You can learn how to build this query by reading our [build a query guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).  <br>  <br>If you have Essential or Elevated access, you can use the Basic operators when building your query and can make queries up to 512 characters long. If you have been approved for Academic Research access, you can use all available operators and can make queries up to 1,024 characters long.  <br>  <br>Learn more about our access levels on the about Twitter API page. |
| `end_time`  <br> Optional | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes the first second of the minute). By default, a request will return Tweets from as recent as 30 seconds ago if you do not include this parameter. |
| `expansions`  <br> Optional | enum (`attachments.poll_ids`, `attachments.media_keys`, `author_id`, `edit_history_tweet_ids`, `entities.mentions.username`, `geo.place_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `referenced_tweets.id`, `referenced_tweets.id.author_id`) | [Expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the Tweet data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the `includes` response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object.  <br>  <br>The following data objects can be expanded using this parameter:  <br><br>* The Tweet author's user object<br>* The user object of the Tweet’s author that the original Tweet is responding to<br>* Any mentioned users’ object<br>* Any referenced Tweets’ author’s user object<br>* Attached media’s object<br>* Attached poll’s object<br>* Attached place’s object<br>* Any referenced Tweets’ object (this includes Tweet objects for previous versions of an edited Tweet) |
| `max_results`  <br> Optional | integer | The maximum number of search results to be returned by a request. A number between 10 and 100. By default, a request response will return 10 results. |
| `media.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`duration_ms`, `height`, `media_key`, `preview_image_url`, `type`, `url`, `width`, `public_metrics`, `non_public_metrics`, `organic_metrics`, `promoted_metrics`, `alt_text`, `variants`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [media fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/media) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media and if you've also included the `expansions=attachments.media_keys` query parameter in your request. While the media ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional media fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `next_token`  <br> Optional | string | This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results. The value used with the parameter is pulled directly from the response provided by the API, and should not be modified. |
| `place.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`contained_within`, `country`, `country_code`, `full_name`, `geo`, `id`, `name`, `place_type`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [place fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/place) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return place fields if the Tweet contains a place and if you've also included the `expansions=geo.place_id` query parameter in your request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional place fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `poll.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`duration_minutes`, `end_datetime`, `id`, `options`, `voting_status`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [poll fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/poll) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if you've also included the `expansions=attachments.poll_ids` query parameter in your request. While the poll ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional poll fields in the `includes` data object. |
| `since_id`  <br> Optional | string | Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. The ID specified is exclusive and responses will not include it. If included with the same request as a `start_time` parameter, only `since_id` will be used. |
| `sort_order`  <br> Optional | enum (`recency`, `relevancy`) | This parameter is used to specify the order in which you want the Tweets returned. By default, a request will return the most recent Tweets first (sorted by recency). |
| `start_time`  <br> Optional | date (ISO 8601) | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC timestamp (from most recent seven days) from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example, 12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). If included with the same request as a `since_id` parameter, only `since_id` will be used. By default, a request will return Tweets from up to seven days ago if you do not include this parameter. |
| `tweet.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`attachments`, `author_id`, `context_annotations`, `conversation_id`, `created_at`, `edit_controls`, `entities`, `geo`, `id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `lang`, `non_public_metrics`, `public_metrics`, `organic_metrics`, `promoted_metrics`, `possibly_sensitive`, `referenced_tweets`, `reply_settings`, `source`, `text`, `withheld`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [Tweet fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) will deliver in each returned Tweet object. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. You can also pass the `expansions=referenced_tweets.id` expansion to return the specified fields for both the original Tweet and any included referenced Tweets. The requested Tweet fields will display in both the original Tweet data object, as well as in the referenced Tweet expanded data object that will be located in the `includes` data object. |
| `until_id`  <br> Optional | string | Returns results with a Tweet ID less than (that is, older than) the specified ID. The ID specified is exclusive and responses will not include it. |
| `user.fields`  <br> Optional | enum (`created_at`, `description`, `entities`, `id`, `location`, `most_recent_tweet_id`, `name`, `pinned_tweet_id`, `profile_image_url`, `protected`, `public_metrics`, `url`, `username`, `verified`, `verified_type`, `withheld`) | This [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) parameter enables you to select which specific [user fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. While the user ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional user fields in the `includes` data object.  <br>  <br>You must also pass one of the user expansions to return the desired user fields:  <br><br>* `expansions=author_id`<br>* `expansions=entities.mentions.username`<br>* `expansions=in_reply_to_user_id`<br>* `expansions=referenced_tweets.id.author_id` |
