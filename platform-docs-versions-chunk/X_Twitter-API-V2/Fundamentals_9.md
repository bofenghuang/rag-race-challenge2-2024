## User

The user object contains Twitter user account metadata describing the referenced user. The user object is the primary object returned in the [users lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/introduction.html) endpoint. When requesting additional user fields on this endpoint, simply use the fields parameter `user.fields`.

The user object can also be found as a child object and expanded in the Tweet object. The object is available for expansion with `?expansions=author_id` or `?expansions=in_reply_to_user_id` to get the condensed object with only default fields. Use the expansion with the field parameter: `user.fields` when requesting additional fields to complete the object.
