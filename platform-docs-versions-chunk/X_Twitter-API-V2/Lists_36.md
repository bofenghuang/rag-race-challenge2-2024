### Manage Lists

The manage List endpoints allow you to create, delete, and update Lists on behalf of an authenticated user. For these endpoints, there are three methods available: POST, DELETE and PUT. The POST method allows you to create a List, the DELETE method allows you to delete a List, and the PUT method allows you to update the metadata of a List. There is a user rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes for all three endpoints.

Note that you can create up to 1000 Lists per account.

**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps) that is located within a [Project](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects).
