Sampled stream

## Getting started with the sampled stream endpoints

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to a sampled stream endpoint using a cURL request. cURL is a command-line tool that allows you to make requests with minimal configuration.

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please visit our [Twitter API v2 sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. The examples there are based on the 1% sampled stream and are easily updated for the 10% sampled stream. See the repository README for more details.Â   

Note: The steps below are also based on making requests to the 1% sampled stream. If you have Enterprise access and are working with the 10% sampled stream, see the Using the 10% sampled stream section below.
