### Steps to build a reverse chronological home timeline request

_For this example, we will make a request to the user Tweet timeline by ID endpoint, but you can apply the learnings from this quick start to user mention timelines requests as well._¬†

#### Step one: Start with a tool or library

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

[Add Twitter API v2 to Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)

  
Once you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the "Timelines" folder and find the "Reverse chronological home timeline" request.

####   
Step two: Authenticate your request

To properly make a request to the Twitter API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication methods.¬†

You must add your keys and tokens to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named ‚ÄúTwitter API v2‚Äù in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

These variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.

#### Step three: Identify and specify which user from which you would like to retrieve their home timeline for

You must specify a user you would like to retrieve recent Tweets for within the request. In this example, we will be passing a single user ID.

User IDs are simply the numerical value that represents an account handle that you can find within an account's profile URL. For example, the following account‚Äôs username is `TwitterDev`.

`https://twitter.com/TwitterDev`

To convert this username to the user ID, you will have to use the [users lookup endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/quick-start)¬†with the username and find the numerical user ID in the payload. In the case of @TwitterDev, the user ID is¬†2244994945.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this user ID into the "Value" column of the id¬†parameter.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | 2244994945 |

#### Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve

If you click the "Send" button after step three, you will receive the default [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/object-reference/tweet) fields in your response: id,¬†text, and edit\_history\_tweet\_ids.

If you would like to receive additional fields,¬†you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/fields) and/or [expansion](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions) parameters.

For this exercise, we will request three additional different sets of fields from different objects:

1. The additional tweet.created\_at field in the primary user objects.  
    
2. The associated authors‚Äô user object‚Äôs default fields for the returned Tweets: id, name, and username
3. The additional¬†user.created\_at field in the associated user objects.  
    ¬†

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:  

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |
| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |
| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |
| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |
| max\_results | 5   |     |

  
You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.twitter.com/2/users/:id/timelines/reverse_chronological?tweet.fields=created_at&expansions=author_id&user.fields=created_at&max_results=5`
    

**Please note:**

In Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id`¬†params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 2244994945.

####   
Step five: Make your request and review your response

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:

      `{ 	"data": [ 		{ 			"created_at": "2022-05-12T17:00:00.000Z", 			"text": "Today marks the launch of Devs in the Details, a technical video series made for developers by developers building with the Twitter API.  üöÄ\n\nIn this premiere episode, @jessicagarson walks us through how she built @FactualCat #WelcomeToOurTechTalk\n‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nhttps://t.co/nGa8JTQVBJ", 			"author_id": "2244994945", 			"id": "1524796546306478083" 		}, 		{ 			"created_at": "2022-05-11T19:16:40.000Z", 			"text": "üì¢ Join @jessicagarson @alanbenlee and @i_am_daniele tomorrow, May 12  | 5:30 ET / 2:30pm PT as they discuss the future of bots https://t.co/sQ2bIO1fz6", 			"author_id": "2244994945", 			"id": "1524468552404668416" 		}, 		{ 			"created_at": "2022-05-09T20:12:01.000Z", 			"text": "Do you make bots with the Twitter API? ü§ñ\n\nJoin @jessicagarson @alanbenlee and @iamdaniele on Thursday, May 12  | 5:30 ET / 2:30pm PT as they discuss the future of bots and answer any questions you might have. üéôüìÜ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nhttps://t.co/2uVt7hCcdG", 			"author_id": "2244994945", 			"id": "1523757705436958720" 		}, 		{ 			"created_at": "2022-05-06T18:19:54.000Z", 			"text": "If you‚Äôd like to apply, or would like to nominate someone else for the program, please feel free to fill out the following form:\n\nhttps://t.co/LUuWj24HLu", 			"author_id": "2244994945", 			"id": "1522642324781633536" 		}, 		{ 			"created_at": "2022-05-06T18:19:53.000Z", 			"text": "We‚Äôve gone into more detail on each Insider in our forum post. \n\nJoin us in congratulating the new additions! ü•≥\n\nhttps://t.co/0r5maYEjPJ", 			"author_id": "2244994945", 			"id": "1522642323535847424" 		} 	], 	"includes": { 		"users": [ 			{ 				"created_at": "2013-12-14T04:35:55.000Z", 				"name": "Twitter Dev", 				"username": "TwitterDev", 				"id": "2244994945" 			} 		] 	}, 	"meta": { 		"result_count": 5, 		"newest_id": "1524796546306478083", 		"oldest_id": "1522642323535847424", 		"next_token": "7140dibdnow9c7btw421dyz6jism75z99gyxd8egarsc4" 	} }`
    

####   
Step six: Paginate through your results

In the previous response, you will find a meta¬†data object at the bottom that includes the following fields:

* oldest\_id
* newest\_id
* results\_count
* next\_token
* previous\_token

In step four, we passed a max\_results value of 5, meaning that each page will only include up to five results. To access the additional pages of data, we will be taking the value of the next\_token field from our last results and adding that string as the value of the¬†pagination\_token parameter on the Postman params page, keeping everything else constant.¬†

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `pagination_token` | t3buvdr5pujq9g7bggsnf3ep2ha28 |

Once this is all set up, you can click "Send" again and you should receive the next page of results.¬†

We have put together a guide on [pagination](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/pagination) to further explain this concept.
