### Optimize for the user (and for usage)

You can design a flow in a way that puts the user in control of any action they intend to make. Keeping this principle in mind also helps you build an integration that can optimize for Tweet consumption.

1. Because the authenticated user can only manage conversations they started, your flow should terminate early when that's not the case.
    * Make an initial Tweet lookup request. Terminate the flow early if the Tweet URL is not valid or the conversation was not started by the authenticating user.
    * This way, your app doesn't have to make a recent search request if the conversation cannot be moderated by the authenticated user.
2. Request [user and Tweet fields](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields.html) in the same request to avoid making separate requests. This approach can also improve your app's performance.
3. Avoid making requests when needed. This app caches a reply's hidden status in the user's browser. This is useful for larger conversations, where the user may want to pick up their moderation efforts at a later stage, and it helps your app optimize requests to hide or unhide replies.
