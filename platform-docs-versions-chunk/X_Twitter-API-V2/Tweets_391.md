### Steps to build a Likes lookup request

#### Step one: Start with a tool or library

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we will use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load the Twitter API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

[Add Twitter API v2 to Postman](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)

Once you have the Twitter API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the "Likes" folder and select "Liking users.‚Äù¬†  
¬†

#### Step two: Authenticate your request

To properly make a request to the Twitter API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so, this endpoint requires you to authenticate your request with either¬†[OAuth 2.0 App-Only](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only),¬†[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), or¬†[OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)¬†authentication methods.

For simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private¬†[metrics](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/metrics)¬†or Tweets.¬†

To utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only, you must add your keys and tokens, specifically the¬†[App Access Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)¬†(also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named ‚ÄúTwitter API v2‚Äù in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

These variables will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.  
  

#### Step three:¬†Specify a Tweet

With this endpoint, you must specify the Tweet ID that you want to get liking users for.¬†¬†You can find the ID of a Tweet by navigating to that Tweet on Twitter and pulling the numerical code at the end of the URL. For example, the following URL's Tweet ID is¬†1354143047324299264.

https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1354143047324299264

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this username into the "Value" column of the tweet\_id path variable (at the bottom of the section), making sure to not include any spaces before or after usernames.¬†

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | The Tweet ID you want to get the liking users of |

####   
Step four:¬†Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve

If you click the "Send" button after step three, you will receive the default [user object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) fields in your response: id, name, and username.

If you would like to receive additional fields beyond id, name, and username, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [fields](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/fields)¬†and/or [expansions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/introduction/expansions)¬†parameters.

For this exercise, we will request three additional sets of fields from different objects:

1. The additional user.created\_at field in the primary user objects.
2. The associated pinned Tweets‚Äô object‚Äôs default fields for the returned users: id and text.
3. The additional¬† tweet.created\_at field in the associated Tweet objects.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |
| user.fields | created\_at | user.created\_at |
| expansions | pinned\_tweet\_id | tweet.id, tweet.text |
| tweet.fields | created\_at | tweet.created\_at |

You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/1354143047324299264/liking_users?user.fields=created_at&expansions=pinned_tweet_id&tweet.fields=created_at`
    

#### Step five: Make your request and review your response

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:

      `{   "data": [     {       "created_at": "2008-12-04T18:51:57.000Z",       "id": "17874544",       "username": "TwitterSupport",       "name": "Twitter Support"     },     {       "created_at": "2007-02-20T14:35:54.000Z",       "id": "783214",       "username": "Twitter",       "name": "Twitter"     },     {       "pinned_tweet_id": "1389270063807598594",       "created_at": "2018-11-21T14:24:58.000Z",       "id": "1065249714214457345",       "username": "TwitterSpaces",       "name": "Spaces"     },     {       "pinned_tweet_id": "1293595870563381249",       "created_at": "2007-05-23T06:01:13.000Z",       "id": "6253282",       "username": "TwitterAPI",       "name": "Twitter API"     }   ],   "includes": {     "tweets": [       {         "created_at": "2021-05-03T17:26:09.000Z",         "id": "1389270063807598594",         "text": "now, everyone with 600 or more followers can host a Space.\n\nbased on what we've learned, these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting because of their existing audience. before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we‚Äôre focused on a few things. üßµ"       },       {         "created_at": "2020-08-12T17:11:04.000Z",         "id": "1293595870563381249",         "text": "Twitter API v2: Early Access released\n\nToday we announced Early Access to the first endpoints of the new Twitter API!\n\n#TwitterAPI #EarlyAccess #VersionBump https://t.co/g7v3aeIbtQ"       }     ]   } }`
    

####   
Step six:¬†Get a user‚Äôs liked Tweets

You might also want to make a request to get a user‚Äôs liked Tweets as well. With the Likes lookup endpoint, you can get information about a user‚Äôs liked Tweets. To do this navigate to the "Likes" folder and select "Liked Tweets‚Äù.¬†

With this endpoint, you must specify the User ID that you want to get liking users for. You can use the [user lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/introduction) endpoint to get this information.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this username into the "Value" column of the id path variable (at the bottom of the section), making sure to not include any spaces before or after usernames.¬†

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| id  | The user ID you want to get the liked Tweets of |
| max\_results | 5   |

You can now see a similar URL with your ID instead of TwitterDev‚Äôs next to the "Send" button:  
¬†

      `https://api.twitter.com/2/users/2244994945/liked_tweets?max_results=5`
    

  
Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive a similar response to the following example response:

      `{   "data": [     {       "id": "1362449997430542337",       "text": "Honored to be the first developer to be featured in @TwitterDev's love fest ü•∞‚ô•Ô∏èüòç https://t.co/g8TsPoZsij"     },     {       "id": "1365416026435854338",       "text": "We're so happy for our Official Partner @Brandwatch and their big news. https://t.co/3DwWBNSq0o https://t.co/bDUGbgPkKO"     },     {       "id": "1296487407475462144",       "text": "Check out this feature on @TwitterDev to learn more about how we're mining social media data to make sense of this evolving #publichealth crisis https://t.co/sIFLXRSvEX."     },     {       "id": "1294346980072624128",       "text": "I awake from five years of slumber https://t.co/OEPVyAFcfB"     },     {       "id": "1283153843367206912",       "text": "@wongmjane Wish we could tell you more, but I‚Äôm only a teapot üëÄ"     }   ],   "meta": {         "next_token": "7140dibdnow9c7btw4539n0vybdnx19ylpayqf16fjt4l",     	  "result_count": 5   } }`
