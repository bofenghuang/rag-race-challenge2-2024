## Manage replies by topic

Through the hide replies endpoint, you can build integrations to help people and brands keep their conversation on topic. This page shows how to manage a conversation using the hide replies and [recent search](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction.html) endpoints.

Recent search has functionality to a conversation and its replies, and the Tweet payload returns [Tweet annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations.html) to help you understand the context and topic of each Tweet, regardless of language.

The app's flow will have controls to display and manage a conversation:

1. It asks the user’s permission to read their Tweets and manage their replies.
2. It pulls a recent conversation from a Tweet URL, and checks that the conversation is from the authenticating user.
3. It will call the recent search endpoint to display each Tweet in the conversation. The request will include a conversation ID search query and the annotation expansion to determine if the Tweet is sports-related or not, according to Twitter's interpretation of the Tweet.
4. It calls Hide replies to hide a reply when the user chooses to do so. It will also provide a way to undo this action in case, so that the user is always in control.   
    
5. For longer conversations, it will provide controls to [paginate through search results](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/paginate.html).
