### Anticipating disconnects and reconnecting

When streaming Tweets, the goal is to stay connected for as long as possible, recognizing that disconnects may occur. The endpoint provides a 20-second keep alive heartbeat (it will look like a new line character). Use this signal to detect if you’re being disconnected.

1. Your code should detect when fresh content and the heartbeat stop arriving.
2. If that happens, your code should trigger a reconnection logic. Some clients and languages allow you to specify a read timeout, which you can set to 20 seconds.
3. Your service should detect these disconnections and reconnect as soon as possible.

The code samples on the API reference page provide an example of this reconnect logic.

Once an established connection drops, attempt to reconnect immediately. If the reconnect fails, slow down your reconnect attempts according to the type of error experienced:

* Back off linearly for TCP/IP level network errors. These problems are generally temporary and tend to clear quickly. Increase the delay in reconnects by 250ms each attempt, up to 16 seconds.
* Back off exponentially for HTTP errors for which reconnecting would be appropriate. Start with a 5 second wait, doubling each attempt, up to 320 seconds.
* Back off exponentially for HTTP 429 errors Rate limit exceeded. Start with a 1 minute wait and double each attempt. Note that every HTTP 429 received increases the time you must wait until rate limiting will no longer be in effect for your account.
