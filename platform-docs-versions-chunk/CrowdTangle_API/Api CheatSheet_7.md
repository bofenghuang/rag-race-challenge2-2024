## /post/:id

* Retrieves a specific post according to its Facebook ID. [Read more about the endpoint here](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Posts#get-postid).
    
* Use the _includeHistory_ parameter to get time-series data for each post -- this is the same data you get when you download a single post CSV in the UI. Note that we will not have time-series data for posts that were created after the account was added to CrowdTangle.
