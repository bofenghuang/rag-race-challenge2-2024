### Metrics and Periods

Some of these metrics are deprecated for v18.0. They will be deprecated for all versions beginning Dec 11, 2023. Please use the alternative metrics listed. See the [Changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/changelog) for more information.

Metrics that support `lifetime` periods will have results returned in an array of 24 hour periods, with periods ending on UTCâˆ’07:00. `audience_*` metrics do not support `since` and `until` [range](#range) parameters.
