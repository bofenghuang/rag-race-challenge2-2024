Complaint outcomes include initial decision upheld, initial decision overturned, mixed result, issue

resolved and other. An “initial decision” refers to the initial enforcement of Google’s terms of service or

product policies. These decisions may be overturned in light of additional information provided by the

appellant or additional review of the content. If there are multiple items in the complaint and the

decision was upheld for some items but overturned for others, this is categorised as a “mixed result”. If a

complaint is withdrawn, if the complaint requires no action, response or decision from Google, or if the

creator resolves the issue so that their content is no longer policy-violating, this is categorised as “issue

resolved”. Table 4.3.1 provides the number of complaints, broken down by service and complaint

outcome.
