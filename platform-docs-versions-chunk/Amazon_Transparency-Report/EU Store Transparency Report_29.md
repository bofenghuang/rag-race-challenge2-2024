Regulatory contacts

If there is an instance where a bad actor or content has evaded our proactive controls or notice systemsand we receive a contact from a regulator, we move quickly to respond and resolve the issue. In the

first half of 2023, we received 1,081 contacts from EU Member Statesâ€™ authorities. The median time

to inform an authority we received their contact was less than one day, and the median time to resolve

the issue they surfaced was two days. Of those contacts, 1,081 were related to product and we had nocontacts related to App, Audio, Image, Synthetic Media, Text, Video, or Other.
