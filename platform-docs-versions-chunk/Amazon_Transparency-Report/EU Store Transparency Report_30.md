When we identify and remove a non-compliant or unsafe product offer or suspend a seller, advertiser,

or rights owner due to a policy violation, we provide clear and actionable communications. We describethe policy violation that led to the enforcement action, and also provide additional information aboutAmazonâ€™s policies and compliance resources that can help users be compliant in the future. We have aprocess to remediate policy violations, appeal enforcements, or dispute enforcements and ask Amazonto re-examine decisions.
