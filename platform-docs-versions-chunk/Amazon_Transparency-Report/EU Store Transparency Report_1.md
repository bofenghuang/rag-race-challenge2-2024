Introduction



Nearly three decades ago, Amazon set out to be Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company, wherepeople can discover and purchase the widest possible selection of safe and authentic goods. As part ofthat mission, we obsess over earning and maintaining trust by ensuring that we provide a trustworthy

shopping experience. We believe that customer trust is difficult to earn and easy to lose. We invest

heavily in people and technology to protect customers, selling partners, brands, and advertisers fromany form of fraud or abuse.
