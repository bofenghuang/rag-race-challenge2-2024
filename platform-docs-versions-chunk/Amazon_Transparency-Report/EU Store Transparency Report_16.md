Amazon EU store’s Intellectual Property Policy provides clear and practical information to sellers aboutintellectual property rights and common intellectual property concerns that might arise when selling inAmazon’s store, including regarding the enforcement of those rights. Amazon has no tolerance for badactors that are attempting to intentionally abuse or circumvent these policies, but we also recognise thathonest, well-intending sellers share Amazon’s mission to protect consumers while respecting the IP

rights of others, but some may unknowingly list a non-compliant or prohibited product because they areunaware of an applicable legal requirement or Amazon policy.
